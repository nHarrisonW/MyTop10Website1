            <h1>Top Formula One Tracks (as of 2022)</h1>
        </div>
        <h4 class="itemText">Formula One is often regarded amongst racing fans as the highest class of racing. Today,
            cars push over
            1,000 horespower and weave through three mile tracks in under two minutes, all with a V6 turbo
            charged hybrid engine. From strict diets for drivers to countless hours testing everything from aerodynamics
            to weight balance, this sport stands for much more than that. 72 years of racing has built legendary names
            such as Enzo Ferarri, Bruce McLaren, and Michael Shumacher, just to name a few. Just as important as the
            teams and drivers, this sport has also brought race fans from around the world to drive the tracks that
            these cars race on. Today we'll be going through some of my favorite tracks as of 2022. This list does not
            acknowledge different eras of racing outside of the hybrid era (cars that are smaller, or do not feature
            DRS). I'm Harrison, and I have been into racing since a young child. In 2006, I loved Fernando Alonso's
            Championship winning Renault R25, but since then, my favorite racing team has been Williams and Mercedes-AMG
            Petronas, and although neither teams are doing well in the Drivers' Championship and the Constructors'
            Championship, I am still faithful that we will be back on top soon than later! I have many hours of
            kart-racing experience and thousands of hours sim-racing on the worlds best tracks. Although I have never
            driven them in real life, these tracks are ranked by the amount of fun they are to DRIVE as well as watch!

                <H1>Honorable Mention: Monaco Grand Prix</H1>
            </div>
            <h5>Known as one of racings oldest circuits, Circuit de Monaco is a race older than Formula One itself. The
                first race was held here in 1929 under Prince Louis II. Back then, the cars didn't even break 150
                horsepower and the race was won by William Grover-Williams in his Bugatti. Almost 100 years later, the
                circuit has become a staple of motorsports and is commonly refered to as racings most difficult circuit.
                Twelve seat-gripping turns, this race is controversial for many reasons. First, being a city circuit,
                there is limited space for barriers that can absorb the impact of a car and protect the drivers, making
                it fairly unsafe by todays standards as the cars become larger and larger. Larger cars also make for a
                more boring race day in Monaco because much of the track is simply too narrow to fit two cars at race
                speed. In the last 10 years, Monaco has seen 101 racers overtake another driver, and most of these are
                due to pit penaltys or failures and usually do not take place on the track. For comparison , the Belgian
                Grand Prix in 2022 had 74 overtakes in total. In 2016, the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai saw a
                staggering 161 overtakes, making a new record. What makes this race exciting to fans today is the qualifying
                round the day before. Teams send their drivers to push every bit of performance out of their car in
                order to get the best lap time, and thus the best starting position. It is absolutely crucial on a
                track were you are unlikely to overtake. Here in 2005, we see Ferarri legend and fan-favorite Kimi
                Raikkonen set his final qualifying lap of the day to take pole postition from Fernando Alonso's
                Renault R25 by almost half a second, and coming in over an entire second in front of his teammate, Juan Montoya. This is just one example of why Raikkonen's name lives on past his departure of the sport. This is commonly regarded as the most epic Formula One qualifying session of all time, and
                lives in infamy to this day.</h5>

                    <p>Amongst the most famous tracks on this list, Spa-Francorchamps is undoubtedly one of racings most
                        adored circuits. Only missing a few seasons of F1 since it held it's first F1 race in the
                        inaugural 1950 season, the Belgian Grand Prix has become a staple event in Formula One.</p>

                    <h5>Eau Rouge</h5>
                    <p>This is one of racings most demanding sections, 'Eau Rouge' sees today's cars scream through at
                        almost 190+ miles per hour. This turn is known as a 'flat out' turn because drivers do not lift
                        from the throttle mostly at all entering and exiting the turn. For that reason, the drivers must have complete faith in their team and car. Even the slightest slip in the tires could be catastrophic to a driver. Most recently, Anthoine Hubert lost control of his car while going though Eau Rouge at over 160 miles per hour due to a missing front wing. By the time Hubert hit the wall, his car was still travelling at over 130 miles per hour with a g-force equivalent to 33.7g. His car was then hit by another racer traveling about 133 miles per hour, causing a maximum g-force of over 80g. Hubert did not survive the second impact, and just goes to show the dangers of Eau Rouge. Since then, new safety measures continue to be brought forward as racing continues on this legenary track. </p>

                        both needed to win the final race of the season at Suzuka Circuit. After chasing for much of the
                        race, Senna believed he had found his chance to pass Prost for the lead. In lap 46 of 53, Senna
                        dove into the final chicane of the lap in an attempt to overtake his teammate. Senna was not
                        able to make the braking zone, causing Prost to turn into him, stopping both cars dead in their
                        tracks. Senna was able to keep his car running and was pushed back into the race by stewards,
                        where he was able to regain the lead, only to be disqualified for his collision with Prost. This was a catalyst event among a season of conflicts between the two teammates that drove Prost to leave McLaren.</p>

                        most difficult tracks to overtake on, Senna decided to dive in at turn 1 in an attempt to put
                        Prost behind him before they collided, causing them both not to finish, thus giving Senna his
                        second world title. Many fans thought this was a dirty move by Senna and accuse the racing
                        legend of intentionally crashing into his ex-teammate in order to win the title. Either way,
                        fans were robbed of a surely epic final race of the 1990 season.</p>

                    <p>Baku is the capital city of the beautiful nation of Azerbaijan. Baku gives a new definition to
                        city circuits. Reaching speeds north of 360 kilometers per hour and a mix of 20 turns, this
                        track also has reminiscence of Monaco, while still giving drivers enough space to overtake each
                        other, especially in today's Formula One cars, which are much bigger and faster than previous
                        seasons.</p>
